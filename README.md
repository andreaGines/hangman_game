# hangman_game
==============

### Required Modules:
  - Need to pip install the pyglet module before running the hangman.py file

### Game rules:
    # 1) When the window shows up, type the first character any letter from [A Z]
    # 2) If you striked then your stike count will increment, but if you guessed right the letter will be uncovered
    # 3) You can keep playing until you have either discovered the word (you win!) or you run out of strikes (you lose)
    # 4) At any point if you want to exit the game just press the RETURN key, or close the window 

    # 5) As soon as you either win or lose the Game is over.
